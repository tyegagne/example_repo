Example repo

This is my compact example of script and version tracking in github

You will find example code in the script folder:

__ANN_sensitivity.R__ - 

 This is a draft script of a sensitivity analysis of variable importance in feed-forward ANNs
 I utilize the variable perturbation methodlogy as a means to test variable importance

 Under repeated ANN training rounds of weighting coefficients on random subsets of the training data
 we get a distribution of feature importance rankings that better approximate the stochastic range of
 feature importance approximation. This approach yields a far more robust measure of feature importance
 than many existing methods.
