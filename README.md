This is my compact example of script and version tracking in github

You will find example code in the script folder, I have also provided a markdown file in this folder to ease code output and interpretation. 

__ANN_sensitivity.R__ - 

 This is a draft script of a sensitivity analysis of variable importance in feed-forward ANNs.
 I utilize the variable perturbation methodlogy as a means to test variable importance.

 Under repeated ANN training rounds of weighting coefficients, on random subsets of the training data,
 we get a distribution of feature importance rankings that better approximate the stochastic range of
 feature importances. This approach yields a far more robust measure of feature importance
 than many existing methods, and subsequently better informs feature selection.
 
 This work is drawn from a larger project that I am currently involved with. This tool is a component of
 work that is developing a pipeline of analysis for complex, non-linear, and interactive relationships
 in global biodiversity patterns. This approach being applied both on land in the ocean with a diverse array
 of data sources such as satellite remote sensing data and ocean observer records.
